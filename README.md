## Applying a script (uBlock Origin)

- Navigate to the uBlock Origin Dashboard (the extension options)
- Under the `My filters` tab add `twitch.tv##+js(twitch-videoad)`.
- Under the `Settings` tab, enable `I am an advanced user`, then click the cog that appears. Modify the value of `userResourcesLocation` from `unset` to the full url of the solution you wish to use (if a url is already in use, add a space after the existing url). e.g. `userResourcesLocation https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BongoCaat/TwitchBlock/main/vaft/vaft-ublock-origin.js` 
- To ensure uBlock Origin loads the script I recommend that you disable/enable the uBlock Origin extension (or restart your browser).

*To stop using a script remove the filter and make the url `unset`.*
